# About me

Hi I'm Tim Fan, (Or Feng-Yun Fan if you're curious, but just save your time and call me Tim) from Taiwan, currently a CS graduate student in University of San Francisco. This is my homepage which will serve as an archive on what I have previously worked on or projects I have shelved and might come back and work on it someday.

I'm also trying to write a blog about things I'm currently studying. Feel free to contact me if you want to collaborate or point out any of my mistakes (I'd be really thankful for that). 

I am currently the TA for course CS521 - System Programming and was previously the TA for course CS336 - Computer Networks.

Anyways, hope you enjoy your stay :)
